# Odin-Etch-a-Sketch
A dynamic web-based Etch-a-Sketch clone built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* Create a customizable grid (from 4x4 up to 100x100).

* Hover over grid squares to apply random colors with progressive darkening (opacity increases 10% per pass).

* Clear/reset functionality to restart your drawing.

* Built using efficient DOM manipulation, event delegation, and Flexbox layout.

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project.
